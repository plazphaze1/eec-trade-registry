# EEC Trade Registry — Delivery Roadmap

Status: Implementation in progress
Delivery strategy: Small, reviewable vertical slices with policy gates and database-first invariants

The cross-domain operating baseline was approved on 2026-08-04 in ADR 0005. Slice-level lists below now distinguish resolved baseline policy from narrower decisions that still block production depth.

## 1. Roadmap principles

- Build one complete workflow at a time rather than all backend layers followed by all frontends.
- Supabase PostgreSQL is authoritative from the first slice.
- Introduce no Google Sheet, Discord, or generated-document dependency before the underlying workflow works without it.
- Every schema change is a migration; every business rule receives tests.
- Add row-level security and audit behavior with each feature, not as a final hardening pass.
- Treat unresolved policy as a gate. Do not encode an arbitrary answer because implementation has begun.
- Prefer a thin end-to-end slice that can be reviewed over a broad partially working subsystem.
- Keep pull requests focused and reversible.

## 2. Phase 0 — Policy and architecture baseline

### Outcomes

- Approve the product boundary and vocabulary strategy.
- Resolve decisions required for the first two slices.
- Establish repository, development, migration, test, preview, and review conventions.
- Define non-production and production Supabase environment strategy.
- Create decision-record and threat-model templates.

### Decisions required

- Initial public catalogue fields and availability language
- Initial item categories and configurable control-profile behavior
- Locale and reporting cutoff details beyond the approved `SEP`/Septims currency and `America/New_York` time zone
- Staff authentication approach for the first internal surface
- Public reference and item-code formats
- Legacy workbook ownership, import permission, and data-quality process

### Candidate deliverables

- Architecture decision records for Supabase boundary, monorepo layout, auth model, and rules strategy
- Initial threat model and data-classification inventory
- Development environment and migration workflow
- CI checks for formatting, types, migrations, and tests
- Seed-data conventions using fictional, non-sensitive data
- Issue epics and acceptance-criteria template

### Exit criteria

- No implementation-blocking ambiguity remains for the public catalogue slice.
- Engineering rules are accepted.
- Environments and secret ownership are documented.
- A reviewer can explain where authoritative business logic will live and how it will be tested.

## 3. Slice 1 — Public catalogue foundation

### User outcome

Anyone can browse a single, coherent public catalogue without logging in.

### Scope

- Canonical items, categories, tags, units, and publication records
- Public price representation and effective dates
- Configurable public control and availability language
- Public catalogue view/function with strict field allowlist
- Search, filtering, item detail, and generated-at display
- Initial validated import of catalogue data from the legacy workbook
- Public RLS and leakage tests
- Basic catalogue audit for staff-originated publication changes, even if management UI follows later

### Explicitly excluded

- Dealer-specific pricing
- Licenses and endorsements
- Orders and reservations
- Warehouse stock management
- Discord and Sheets publishing

### Exit criteria

- One item appears once in authoritative data, regardless of how many audiences may later see it.
- Anonymous callers can read only the approved projection.
- Money is numeric in storage and formatted in presentation.
- Ambiguous legacy values are reported, not guessed.
- Search and filters work against realistic seed volume.
- Tests prove unpublished and restricted fields cannot leak.

## 4. Slice 2 — Staff catalogue management

Implementation status: The first policy-neutral increment provides Supabase Auth cookie sessions initiated by Discord OAuth, a fixed server-side PKCE callback, effective-dated catalogue role assignments, an authorized internal work queue, and audited create/edit/archive commands with optimistic concurrency. ADR 0019 adds a rapid configuration workspace, atomic item/supply onboarding, effective-dated public presentation replacement, explicit-schedule price set/clear, no-code reference creation, and retry receipts. ADR 0021 adds a pending Discord identity queue, Owner/Agent presentation, audited owner decisions, and dashboard visibility while preserving the rule that provider authentication grants no database authority.

ADR 0023 adds the simplified operations shell: eight primary destinations, four routine starting actions, non-zero attention sentences, one explained advanced Staff tools panel, derived buyer-channel selection, fast player-material purchasing, and a single ordinary Operator Guide. Existing secure commands and advanced routes remain available without competing for primary navigation.

ADR 0024 completes the storefront boundary for primary work: staff and business ordering use searchable products and carts; the Stock page is an item-and-availability list with inline receipt entry; ordinary order progression uses one visible next action; and reservation, version, ledger, and correction machinery is moved to Owner-only system records.

ADR 0025 removes the remaining setup detours: public licensing is a short link-selected business form; Stock includes every zero- or nonzero item and routes it to the correct intake method; ordinary receipt derives location; guaranteed buying prices are one-field records on Buy materials; first-seller registration asks only for a name; and the reserve-economy screen is dark Owner-only evidence rather than a normal workflow.

ADR 0027 consolidates the remaining item-level detours into **Stock & prices**. Each item now shows ledger-derived availability, base selling price, and applicable Company buying price, with inline ordinary receipt, player purchase, seller setup, and price replacement. The underlying ledger, procurement offer, and effective-dated price commands remain separate and authoritative.

ADR 0028 removes email and Discord from ordinary business access. An Owner sets or resets one private code on the business record; the business signs in with its current license number and that code. Business and staff sessions use separate cookies, the code hash remains in Supabase Auth, and license/authorization/representative checks still fail closed in PostgreSQL.

ADR 0029 removes the final split in ordinary business onboarding. A configured license-class profile lets one reviewed public application create the business party, current dealer authorization, and linked license atomically. The staff queue presents one **Approve business** action, while imported or exceptional records keep manual tools. Order detail is also reduced to a compact item work list with one state and one next action per line.

ADR 0031 removes the advanced dashboard catalogue that still made the console feel like two applications. Today now exposes only routine work, live exceptions, recent orders, and four compact Owner administration links. Specialist custody, compliance, pricing, document, and policy work remains searchable or contextual. The superseded Buy materials page redirects to **Record activity**, and unused launch actions and links are retired without deleting authoritative functions or history.

ADR 0032 removes the remaining catch-all configuration page. **Products** owns product creation and public presentation, **Stock & prices** and **Record activity** own quantities and normal prices, and **Company setup** contains reusable reference choices only. The atomic onboarding, ledger, permission, and audit functions remain unchanged beneath the smaller interface.

### User outcome

Authorized staff can maintain the master catalogue, prices, publication, and control metadata; public output changes from the same source record.

### Scope

- Staff authentication and minimal role assignment
- Catalogue work queue and create/edit/archive operations
- Effective-dated public price and publication management
- Control-profile and requirement assignment
- Approval path for high-impact changes if policy requires it
- Complete audit entries with previous and new state
- Migration and function tests, including concurrent/effective-date cases

### Remaining decisions

- Catalogue manager approval authority
- Price rule precedence for public pricing
- Backdating and scheduled publication policy
- Archive, rename, and item-code correction policy

### Exit criteria

- Staff UI cannot bypass secure functions for consequential changes.
- Every published change is attributable and historical price state can be reconstructed.
- Public catalogue reflects committed changes without manual duplication.
- Incorrect permissions and cross-scope access are covered by tests.

## 5. Slice 3 — Parties, dealers, and licensing

Implementation status: The public-verification increment provides configurable jurisdictions, party and dealer types, public-disclosure controls, dealer and license status definitions, license classes, modular endorsements, public conditions, exact-reference privacy-safe functions, and dealer/license pages. Dealer administration adds atomic party onboarding, configurable authorization types and statuses, versioned detail maintenance, activation/suspension/reinstatement/revocation, durable public-projection events, a least-privilege role, and a dedicated staff console. Credential access adds dealer actor identities, configurable representative roles, effective-dated scoped representation, cross-organization isolation, and a private read-only registry overview. The staff licensing lifecycle adds a work queue, configurable reference allocation, audited/idempotent issuance, versioned license commands, modular endorsement grant/revocation, and durable outbox records. Constrained public applications, private status tokens, renewals, requested endorsements, atomic decisions, and a dedicated 90-day staff review workspace are implemented. Ordinary new approval now creates the configured business, active dealer authorization, and linked public license in one transaction. Secure-link exchange, broader renewal rules, factor assignments, scheduled expiration, and production abuse controls remain gated.

### User outcome

Staff can authorize dealers and issue real licenses with modular endorsements; the public can verify approved records.

### Scope

- Parties, organizations, representatives, dealer authorizations, jurisdictions, and factor assignments
- License classes, endorsement definitions, conditions, applications, reviews, issuance, and status history
- Public dealer and license verification functions and pages
- Dealer enrollment foundation and secure representation model
- Staff licensing work queue
- Renewal, suspension, reinstatement, revocation, and surrender at the minimum approved policy depth
- Permission, privacy, and audit tests

### Decisions required

- Exact holder eligibility for the approved initial classes
- Exact prerequisites for the approved modular endorsements
- Dealer and regional factor definitions
- Effective dates, duration, renewal, grace, and provisional authority
- Any future expansion beyond the approved public allowlist and exact-reference lookup
- Action-specific licensing approval limits or dual-control rules, if any

### Exit criteria

- A pending application cannot be mistaken for a valid license.
- Public verification exposes only approved fields and has privacy-safe miss behavior.
- Status changes are effective-dated, authorized, and audited.
- Endorsements are independent of price schedules and item publication.
- Dealer representative access cannot cross organization boundaries.

## 6. Slice 4 — Dealer catalogue and wholesale ordering

Implementation status: Lightweight Supabase credential sessions, effective-dated representative scopes, current dealer-authorization checks, and the private organization registry overview are implemented. The wholesale increment includes searchable dealer and staff storefronts, cart entry, authoritative trade-price snapshots, staff-assisted entry for a verified business, direct-individual premium pricing and limits, dealer tracking and cancellation, a staff queue, control-specific review, awaiting-stock handling, optimistic concurrency, audit/history, and notification outbox records. Dealer-specific eligibility exceptions, drafts, and override objects remain future work, while fungible reservations and fulfillment are implemented in later slices.

### User outcome

An authenticated dealer can see applicable terms, submit a requisition, and track review; staff can process it without manually recalculating eligibility or price.

### Scope

- Dealer authentication through the approved lightweight path
- Staff-assisted requisition entry on behalf of a verified authorized business, without staff impersonation or direct-row writes
- Private catalogue evaluation by dealer, license, endorsement, jurisdiction, and price schedule
- Order drafts; submission, line snapshots, review queue, approvals, denials, cancellations, and status history are implemented at initial intake depth
- Effective-dated price schedules and deterministic selection
- Price override request and approval records
- Quota policy foundation and holds if required by approved timing
- Policy-safe dealer status explanations
- Notification outbox records without external Discord delivery yet

### Remaining decisions

- Price schedule audience and precedence; price values may remain unset and editable
- Dealer order authority and representative verification
- Approval thresholds by control level, value, quantity, and region
- Quota subject, window, timing, reset, carryover, and exception rules
- Substitution and split-shipment details beyond approved partial, cancellation, and awaiting-stock behavior
- Payment, deposit, credit, and debt checks included in v1

### Exit criteria

- Order submission revalidates and snapshots authoritative price and rule provenance.
- Dealer cannot see or act on another party's records.
- Restricted and unique items cannot follow an ordinary auto-approval path.
- Override decisions are separate, reasoned, and audited.
- Retried submissions do not create duplicate orders or quota entries.

## 7. Slice 5 — Reservations and warehouse ledger

Implementation status: the current increments configure the EEC warehouse and locations without inventing opening stock; add physical/external accounts, balanced immutable fungible receipts and issues, linked reversals, ledger-derived positions, warehouse-scoped staff roles, atomic 48-hour reservation management, and fungible reservation consumption coupled to fulfillment, order-line, and order state. ADR 0018 adds configurable player-sourced supply policy, named suppliers, effective-dated guaranteed purchase offers, delivery/receipt intake, settlement evidence, reserve targets, demand visibility, and an economy dashboard. ADR 0030 adds anonymous aggregate purchase intake, automatic effective-rate spend snapshots, explicit unpriced exceptions, a purchase Money projection, and Owner-only counted-total reconciliation that posts a ledger difference. Exact purchase rates and reserve targets remain unset until staff configure them. Serialized receipt and custody, picking stages, returns, formal count sessions, thresholded adjustment approval, scheduled expiry execution, resale price schedules, and deeper low-stock automation remain future work.

### User outcome

Staff can receive, reserve, fulfill, transfer, and reconcile stock with a complete ledger trail; dealers see reliable reservation and collection status.

### Scope

- Warehouses, locations, inventory accounts, transaction headers, and immutable ledger entries
- Derived on-hand, reserved, and available positions
- Atomic reservation, extension, release, expiration, and consumption
- Receipts, issues, returns, losses, damage, reversal, and reconciliation adjustment
- Picking, ready-for-collection, collection, and partial fulfillment
- Scheduled reservation expiry
- Inventory work queues and low-stock projections
- Concurrency and idempotency tests

### Remaining decisions

- Exact stock-ready trigger and reservation extension limit beyond the approved 48-hour initial term
- Quantitative exceptional-adjustment and variance thresholds; negative stock is prohibited
- Physical count assignment and recount procedure beyond approved blind entry and variance review
- Stock states and owner/custodian account conventions
- Uncollected-order and partial-fulfillment policy
- Whether quota holds and stock reservations are always coupled

### Exit criteria

- No application path directly overwrites a current-stock value.
- Two concurrent requests cannot reserve the same final quantity.
- A posted movement can be corrected only through a linked reversal/correction.
- Fulfillment consumes reservations, posts inventory, updates quota, writes history/audit, and emits events atomically.
- Staff can reconstruct a calculated balance from ledger entries.

## 8. Slice 6 — Transfers, consignment, and unique assets

Implementation status: the custody increments add fungible warehouse transfer requests, explicit authorization, balanced source-to-transit dispatch, destination receipt, discrepancy recording, pre-dispatch cancellation; a serialized-asset registry with stable identities, exclusive allocations, accepted custody events, inspections, and controlled lifecycle transitions; and fungible consignment agreements, retained-owner dealer custody, dealer observations, exact staff reconciliation, balanced sale/return settlement, and staff/dealer custody views. All paths use scoped permissions, optimistic concurrency, idempotency, immutable history, audit evidence, outbox events, and dedicated consoles. Transfer returns, partial discrepancy resolution, consignment finance and loss/damage exceptions, transaction-specific unique fulfillment, serialized consignment, external custody acceptance, and formal asset correction remain future increments.

### User outcome

The organization can control custody across warehouses, factors, and dealers; serialized goods remain individually traceable.

### Scope

- Transfer request, authorization, dispatch, in-transit, receipt, dispute, and return
- Owner/custodian separation
- Consignment agreements, issue, dealer reports, acceptance, return, and reconciliation
- Serialized asset registration, exclusive reservation, custody event history, condition, and inspection scheduling
- Unique-transaction approvals and custody acceptance
- Missing, damaged, seized, retired, destroyed, and recovered lifecycle events at approved depth
- Dealer and staff custody views

### Remaining decisions

- Proof details for the approved wholesale title-transfer point
- Consignment pricing, financial settlement, reporting cadence, shrinkage tolerance, and loss/damage exception policy beyond retained ownership and exact unit reconciliation
- Transfer acceptance and discrepancy procedure
- Unique-asset approval authority, circulation rules, and inspection cadence
- Serialized-asset public disclosure
- Custody correction and emergency-seizure controls

### Exit criteria

- Dispatched stock is represented in transit and cannot disappear between locations.
- Consigned stock retains configured ownership while custody changes.
- A unique asset cannot have two active reservations or current custodians.
- Post-dispatch cancellation is impossible; exceptions use recorded return or dispute paths.
- Asset lifecycle is reconstructable without using messages or documents as evidence of current state.

## 9. Slice 7 — Projection integrations

Implementation status: the first production-oriented integration increment implements server-only projection functions, disabled-by-default destination records, 15-minute catalogue/dealer/license Google Sheet definitions, leased and retryable export runs, outbox-to-destination delivery materialization, versioned Discord alert templates, signed public `/catalogue`, `/dealer`, and `/license` interactions, a protected server worker triggered by Supabase Cron, and an authenticated staff console for configuration, monitoring, manual export, and safe replay. Private Discord identity binding, generated documents, final destination ownership, retention, and escalation policy remain gated.

### User outcome

Approved public data reaches Google Sheets and users receive timely Discord lookups and notifications without creating secondary business state.

### Scope

- Transactional outbox worker and delivery monitoring
- Public Google Sheet export definitions, full/versioned export, freshness markers, checksums, and retries
- Discord public lookup commands against public functions
- Discord private bot lookup after command-specific identity binding (future policy-gated depth)
- Versioned notification templates and destination policies
- Staff monitoring and safe replay controls
- Generated license/order documents if prioritized and policy-approved

### Remaining decisions

- Sheet destinations, columns, public ownership, and stale-data language beyond the approved 15-minute cadence
- Discord server/channel mapping, bot/command identity binding, and retention beyond the approved read-only commands and private staff alerts; staff OAuth is already decided by ADR 0009
- Which events are public, dealer-private, staff-only, or silent
- Generated document authority, signature/seal, template ownership, and retention

### Exit criteria

- Sheet edits cannot change authoritative data.
- Discord messages cannot approve or fulfill a transaction outside secure business functions.
- Duplicate event delivery does not create duplicate messages or exports beyond defined replacement behavior.
- Staff can see failures, retry safely, and identify the source business record.
- Public outputs expose only approved projection fields.

## 10. Slice 8 — Compliance, appeals, and operational hardening

Implementation status: the policy-neutral casework increment adds configurable case, allegation, and record-only action types; private case assignment and state transitions; planned/completed inspections; immutable allegations, evidence metadata, and explicit findings; record-only action recommendation/review; appeal filing and outcome history; scoped staff permissions; audit/outbox behavior; and a staff case console. The operational-access increment adds an elevated but narrowly composed platform-administrator role, effective-dated audited role grants and revocations, last-administrator protection, private access-audit review, and policy-neutral counts for failed or stale integration, reservation, transfer, and compliance work. It deliberately applies no cross-domain enforcement effect and does not infer filing deadlines, standing, notice, independence, stays, evidence retention, restoration, incident ownership, or recovery objectives. Backup/recovery exercises, abuse controls, accessibility validation, and formal security review remain in progress.

### User outcome

Staff can investigate and resolve compliance matters with due process, while operators can run and recover the platform safely.

### Scope

- Compliance case, inspection, allegation, finding, evidence, action, and appeal workflows
- Atomic effects on licenses, endorsements, quotas, orders, reservations, custody, or standing
- Role independence and dual approval where required
- Operational dashboards for stuck work, stale projections, reconciliation variance, and integration failures
- Backup, recovery, incident, secret rotation, data retention, and privacy procedures
- Performance, accessibility, abuse, rate-limit, and disaster-recovery validation
- Audit export and independent review

### Decisions required

- Violation taxonomy, evidence standard, notice, action, and appeal policy
- Emergency authority and after-the-fact review
- Data retention, privacy, redaction, and deletion policy
- Availability and recovery objectives
- Production support ownership and escalation

### Exit criteria

- Allegations and findings are distinguishable in data and permissions.
- An enforcement effect and its domain state changes commit atomically.
- Appeal outcomes are authorized, historical, and reproducible.
- Restore and secret-rotation procedures are exercised successfully.
- Launch threat model and permission review have no unaccepted critical findings.

## 11. Cross-cutting work in every slice

Each slice includes:

- Product-owner decision review
- Data classification and threat-model update
- Migration with rollback/forward-fix notes
- RLS and secure-function review
- Business-rule, permission, concurrency, and idempotency tests proportional to risk
- Audit and outbox behavior
- Observability and safe error contracts
- Accessibility and responsive behavior for affected UI
- Documentation updates
- Seed fixtures with no real credentials or sensitive user data

## 12. Suggested GitHub epics

- `EPIC: Platform policy and architecture`
- `EPIC: Catalogue foundation`
- `EPIC: Staff catalogue management`
- `EPIC: Parties, dealers, and regional factors`
- `EPIC: Licensing and endorsements`
- `EPIC: Dealer wholesale ordering`
- `EPIC: Inventory ledger and reservations`
- `EPIC: Transfers and consignment`
- `EPIC: Restricted and unique asset registry`
- `EPIC: Discord integration`
- `EPIC: Google Sheets exports`
- `EPIC: Compliance and appeals`
- `EPIC: Security and operational readiness`

Every implementation issue should identify:

- User outcome and non-goals
- Policy decisions it depends on
- Authoritative function and transaction boundary
- Tables/views/functions and migration impact
- Permission and data-exposure impact
- Audit and integration events
- Acceptance tests
- Rollout or data-migration risk

## 13. Release gates

### Before any public beta

- Public projection reviewed for privacy and enumeration risk
- Rate limiting and abuse monitoring in place
- No direct anonymous table access
- Catalogue import exceptions resolved or explicitly excluded
- Backup and restore confirmed for the environment

### Before dealer beta

- Representative enrollment and revocation tested
- Cross-dealer isolation tests passing
- Secure-link/token handling reviewed
- Order and price snapshots reproducible
- Support and account-recovery path defined

### Before warehouse use

- Concurrency and idempotency tests passing
- Reversal and reconciliation procedure rehearsed
- No direct stock-overwrite path
- Warehouse scopes and high-risk adjustment approvals confirmed
- Migration and restore tested with representative ledger volume

### Before integrations become public

- Outbox retries and deduplication proven
- Destination and field allowlists approved
- Stale data and generated-at behavior visible
- Secret rotation and channel/Sheet ownership documented
- Integration principal cannot access unrelated tables or functions

### Before production launch

- Permission matrix approved
- Threat model and privacy review complete
- Critical policy decisions resolved
- Incident, backup, restore, and secret-rotation exercises complete
- Production response-security headers validated and external rate limits/abuse monitoring evidenced
- Audit retention and compliance evidence policy approved
- No open critical or high-severity security defects without explicit owner acceptance

## 14. Deferred capabilities

These may be useful later but are not assumed in the core roadmap:

- Real-world payment processing, payroll, tax, securities, and regulated banking
- Auctions, competitive bids, and political allocation rounds
- Advanced analytics and forecasting
- Multiple languages or non-standard calendars
- External game-server enforcement
- Additional application abuse controls beyond the constrained token-based public intake
- Offline warehouse operation
- Native mobile applications
- Federation with other organizations' registries

Each deferred capability must preserve Supabase authority and existing audit invariants if added.

## 14.1 Implemented fictional-currency banking increment

ADR 0033 adds the server's authoritative Septim Treasury, business/personal/escrow accounts, balanced entries, statements, holds, freezes, order invoicing and partial payment, coupled procurement/consignment expenditure, business-portal banking, reusable loan products, disbursement, schedules, repayment allocation, default, and write-off evidence. Account search is paginated server-side and overview payloads are bounded for large deployments.

Purpose-built invoice refund/payment correction, purpose-built loan payment correction, scheduled fee assessment, credit limits, multi-currency exchange, reconciliation import, bulk account administration, and formal financial period close remain later increments. They must extend rather than bypass the balanced immutable ledger.

## 15. Key risks and mitigations

| Risk | Early mitigation |
|---|---|
| Policy encoded before it is agreed | Maintain a decision register and gate dependent issues |
| Duplicated catalogues return through exports | One canonical item model; projections only |
| Overselling under concurrency | Atomic reservation functions and race tests |
| Staff receive overly broad access | Composable scoped roles, RLS, negative permission tests |
| Unique goods lose traceability | Serialized assets and custody events before unique fulfillment |
| Spreadsheet becomes de facto source | One-way exports, visible timestamps, no import path |
| Discord becomes approval system | Secure function boundary and purpose-limited bot scopes |
| Historical corrections destroy evidence | Append-only ledger/events and linked reversals |
| Configurable rules become unsafe code | Constrained rule model, versioning, deterministic precedence |
| Empty or ambiguous legacy values become policy | Staging, exception reports, owner decisions |
| Large initial scope delays useful release | Vertical slices with explicit exclusions and exit criteria |

## 16. Assumptions

- The first usable release is the public catalogue, not a complete enterprise platform.
- One repository is sufficient for the portal, staff console, Discord service, shared packages, and Supabase assets initially.
- The product owner is available to resolve policy gates between slices.
- Legacy workbook data is useful input but not an architectural specification.
- Integrations can wait until the core workflows are stable.

## 17. Unresolved delivery decisions

- Target hosting and frontend framework
- Monorepo tooling and package manager
- Supabase local-development and environment-promotion process
- CI provider requirements beyond GitHub Actions defaults
- Beta participants, production launch criteria, and operational owner
- Whether catalogue import precedes or follows staff management UI
- Which compliance and finance capabilities are required for first production use
- Accessibility target and supported browser/device matrix
- Expected data volume, peak concurrency, and performance objectives
- Recovery point, recovery time, availability, and maintenance-window objectives

The roadmap should be revised after each approved policy decision and completed slice; it is not a fixed feature promise.
