# EEC Trade Registry — Conceptual Data Model

Status: Governing conceptual model; implementation proceeds under ADR 0005
Database: Supabase PostgreSQL  
Authority: Supabase is the only authoritative source of business data.

## 1. Modeling conventions

### 1.1 General rules

- Use UUID primary keys internally unless a measured requirement justifies another type.
- Keep human-readable codes in separate immutable, unique columns. Codes are references, not primary keys.
- Use `timestamptz` in UTC for instants and `date` only for policy dates with no time-of-day meaning.
- Use integer minor units plus a currency reference for money. Never use floating-point money.
- Use effective-dated records for rules and authorizations that change over time.
- Prefer reference tables or validated configuration records for changeable domain vocabulary.
- Stable machine statuses may use constrained text or PostgreSQL enums only when their transition semantics are truly stable. Display labels remain configurable.
- Every mutable authoritative table includes `created_at`, `created_by`, `updated_at`, and `updated_by` where meaningful.
- Consequential changes also create an immutable audit entry; timestamps alone are not sufficient history.
- Soft deletion is not a universal substitute for history. Use explicit archive, inactive, reversal, supersession, or terminal status semantics.

### 1.2 Configuration-first terminology

The following must not be inferred from names or embedded in frontend conditionals:

- Jurisdictions and regions
- Party and dealer types
- Staff titles and regional factor portfolios
- License classes and endorsement definitions
- Item categories, tags, and control profiles
- Price schedules, quotas, circulation rules, and approval policies
- Currency labels, document prefixes, number formats, and notification templates

The working labels `ordinary`, `restricted`, and `unique` describe initial control behaviors. They must be seeded configuration codes or behavior flags, not lore-specific item-name logic.

### 1.3 Derived values

Do not store a value as freely editable state when it can be authoritatively derived. Examples:

- `inventory_on_hand` = posted inventory ledger movements
- `inventory_available` = on-hand minus active reservations, with approved policy adjustments
- `license_is_valid` = status, effective dates, holder/dealer standing, and applicable conditions
- `quota_remaining` = allowance plus adjustments minus committed consumption and active holds
- `asset_current_custodian` = accepted custody events
- `expiring_soon` = expiration date compared with a configured window

Materialized views or caches may accelerate these values, but they remain rebuildable projections and are updated transactionally or refreshed from source records.

## 3. Identity and access

### `actor_profiles`

Application-level identity linked one-to-one with `auth.users` when the actor authenticates.

Key fields:

- `id`
- `auth_user_id` nullable and unique
- `display_name`
- `actor_type` such as staff, dealer representative, integration, or system
- `status`
- `last_authenticated_at`

An actor is not necessarily a legal or commercial party. A representative may authenticate as an actor while acting for an organization party.

Implementation note: actor profiles currently support the stable machine types `staff` and `dealer`. User-facing role and organization titles remain configuration records.

### `staff_access_requests`

Owner-review record created from a confirmed Discord/Supabase identity. It is deliberately separate from `actor_profiles` and `staff_assignments`: pending authentication is not authority.

Key fields:

- `auth_user_id`, immutable `discord_user_id`, and non-authoritative `display_name`
- `status`: pending, approved, denied, or blocked
- `requested_at`, `last_attempted_at`, `reviewed_at`
- `reviewed_by_actor_id`, optional resulting `approved_actor_id`, and `review_reason`
- first/review request identifiers and optimistic `version`

The authenticated user may read only a constrained self-state function. Owners read the queue through a permission-checked projection and decide it through a versioned command. Approval creates or reactivates exactly one actor and current Agent assignment atomically. Audit history and outbox work commit with the decision.

### `staff_roles`

Configurable role definitions with stable permission bundles or references to permission scopes.

Key fields:

- `id`, `code`, `display_name`
- `description`
- `is_assignable`
- `is_elevated`

Implementation note: ADR 0021 adds user-facing `owner` and `agent` bundles. Granular legacy roles and permission scopes remain internal authorization machinery, but the normal server-owner interface does not ask an administrator to compose technical roles. A business remains a represented party, never a staff role.

### `staff_assignments`

Effective-dated assignment of an actor to a role and optional jurisdiction, warehouse, or portfolio.

Key fields:

- `actor_id`, `staff_role_id`
- `jurisdiction_id` nullable
- `warehouse_id` nullable
- `effective_from`, `effective_until`
- `granted_by`, `revoked_by`, `revoked_at`

### `party_representatives`

Effective-dated authority for an actor or person party to act for another party.

Key fields:

- `principal_party_id`
- `representative_party_id` nullable
- `actor_id` nullable
- `authority_scope`
- `effective_from`, `effective_until`
- `status`, `verified_at`, `verified_by`

At least one representative identity is required. The authorization function must validate both dates and scope.

Implementation note: the business portal uses one organization actor and an active representative grant with `portal.read`, order, and optional consignment scopes. The visible sign-in is license number plus private access code; no email or Discord identity is requested.

### `business_portal_accounts`

Lifecycle metadata binding one business party to its dedicated Supabase Auth actor. It stores no access code and no credential hash; Supabase Auth is the only credential store.

Key fields:

- `party_id`, `actor_id`
- `status`
- `credential_version`, `credential_rotated_at`
- `activated_at`, `disabled_at`
- `created_by_actor_id`, `updated_by_actor_id`
- idempotent request identifiers and timestamps

The staff activation command creates or reactivates the business actor and scoped representative grant atomically. Disabling blocks the actor and revokes active grants so an already-issued browser session cannot keep using protected business functions.

### `portal_access_grants`

Metadata for secure private-link access when used. Raw tokens are never stored.

Key fields:

- `id`, `party_id`, optional `actor_id`
- `token_digest`
- `scope`
- `issued_at`, `expires_at`, `used_at`, `revoked_at`
- `issued_by`, `last_ip_hash` or other privacy-approved abuse metadata

Preferred behavior is to exchange the grant for a short-lived scoped session. Reuse, extension, and revocation policies are unresolved.

### `integration_principals`

Narrowly scoped non-human identities for Discord, Google export, document generation, and scheduled jobs.

Key fields:

- `id`, `code`, `display_name`
- `allowed_scopes`
- `status`
- `credential_reference` containing only a secret-manager reference, never the secret

## 4. Configuration and jurisdiction

### `jurisdictions`

Hierarchical regions or operating territories.

Key fields:

- `id`, `code`, `display_name`
- `parent_id` nullable
- `status`
- `default_timezone`

### `currencies`

Display and arithmetic metadata.

Key fields:

- `id`, `code`, `display_name`, `symbol`
- `minor_unit_scale`
- `rounding_mode`
- `status`

Initial configured record: code `SEP`, display name `Septims`, zero fractional minor units. This is deployment data, not a currency branch in application logic.

### `number_sequences`

Configuration for human-friendly public references, with allocation performed by an authoritative function.

Key fields:

- `id`, `document_type`, optional `jurisdiction_id`
- `prefix_template`, `next_value`, `padding`
- `reset_policy`

Sequence allocation must be concurrency-safe. Once assigned, references do not change if display names or regions are renamed.

### `policy_versions`

Optional registry of approved policy bundles or rule versions.

Key fields:

- `id`, `code`, `display_name`
- `effective_from`, `effective_until`
- `approved_by`, `approved_at`
- `configuration` or links to normalized rule records

Business records should store the policy or rule version used when reproducibility matters.

### `staff_command_receipts`

Restricted idempotency evidence for compound staff commands. A receipt stores the request UUID, stable operation code, actor, result identifier, result version, and a small safe result object. It is not a business-state cache and grants no read or write authority. Rapid item onboarding, configuration creation, and public-term replacement serialize on the request UUID and return the recorded result on retry.

## 5. Parties, dealers, and factors

Implementation status: the public-verification increment implements jurisdictions, party types, protected party source records, dealer types, configurable dealer statuses, and effective-dated dealer authorizations. Contacts, external identities, representatives, factors, standing, and staff mutation commands remain future policy-gated work.

### `parties`

One record per person, organization, public institution, or system-recognized commercial entity.

Key fields:

- `id`, `party_type_id`
- `legal_name`, `display_name`
- `public_reference` nullable and unique
- `status`
- `primary_jurisdiction_id` nullable
- `public_profile_enabled`

Sensitive contact and identity data should be stored in separately protected tables rather than mixed into public-facing party fields.

### `party_types`

Configurable classification such as person, business, institution, government body, or other deployment-specific type.

### `party_contacts`

Contact points with verification and visibility classification.

Key fields:

- `party_id`, `contact_type`, `value_ciphertext` or appropriately protected value
- `visibility` such as private, staff, dealer, or public
- `verified_at`, `status`

### `external_identities`

Bindings to approved external systems, including Discord.

Key fields:

- `party_id` or `actor_id`
- `provider`, `external_subject_id`
- `verified_at`, `verified_by`, `revoked_at`

Never use a display name as an identity key.

### `dealer_authorizations`

Effective-dated authorization for a party to operate as a dealer or approved counterparty.

Key fields:

- `id`, `dealer_party_id`, `public_reference`
- `dealer_type_id`, `jurisdiction_id`
- `status`
- `approved_premises` or normalized premises references
- `effective_from`, `effective_until`
- `sponsoring_party_id` or `factor_assignment_id` nullable
- `public_notes`, `private_notes`
- `approved_by`, `approved_at`

Dealer authorization and licensing are separate. Policy may require both.

### `factor_assignments`

Appoints a party or actor as a regional factor for a period and scope.

Key fields:

- `factor_party_id`, optional `actor_id`
- `jurisdiction_id`, optional `portfolio_definition`
- `authority_profile_id`
- `effective_from`, `effective_until`
- `status`, `appointed_by`

The title alone grants no permission; functions resolve authority from the assignment and profile.

### `standing_records`

Effective-dated internal standing or risk classifications for a party or dealer.

Key fields:

- `party_id`, `standing_type_id`
- `effective_from`, `effective_until`
- `reason`, `recorded_by`
- `publicly_disclosable`

Standing is private by default and must not be returned by public verification functions.

## 6. Licensing

Implementation status: the public-verification increment implements configurable license classes and statuses, issued-license source records, modular endorsement grants, public/private conditions, and narrow exact-reference projections. The staff lifecycle increment adds transactional reference allocation, idempotent issuance, versioned status commands, endorsement grant/revocation, append-only domain events, complete audit context, and durable outbox events. Applications, reviews, renewal, condition mutation, and scheduled expiration remain future policy-gated work.

### `license_classes`

Configurable definitions of license families.

Key fields:

- `id`, `code`, `display_name`, `description`
- `default_duration`
- `holder_party_types`
- `public_disclosure_profile_id`
- `status`

### `endorsement_definitions`

Modular authorities or commodity scopes attachable to licenses.

Key fields:

- `id`, `code`, `display_name`, `description`
- `default_duration`
- `requires_endorsement_id` nullable
- `exclusivity_group` nullable
- `status`

### `license_applications`

Requests for a new license, renewal, endorsement change, reinstatement, or other configured service.

Key fields:

- `id`, `public_reference`
- `application_type`
- `applicant_party_id`, optional `dealer_authorization_id`
- `requested_license_class_id`
- `jurisdiction_id`
- `status`
- `submitted_at`, `assigned_to`, `decided_at`, `decided_by`
- `decision`, `decision_reason`
- `source_payload` for versioned answers, subject to retention and privacy controls

Application status is not license status.

Implementation note: the current constrained public intake stores applicant/contact text, requested class, jurisdiction, renewal target, statement, status-token digest, requested endorsements, review evidence, and the resulting license link. The dedicated staff review projection returns pending work and 90 days of decision history without granting direct table access. For a new request without an existing holder, the authoritative approval command uses the class onboarding profile to create the canonical business party, dealer authorization, and linked license in one transaction.

### `license_application_onboarding_profiles`

Configures how an approved new public application becomes a licensed business. One profile per license class selects the party type, dealer type, initial dealer status, and public-disclosure default. This mapping prevents application code from inferring authority from display labels or hard-coded setting terminology.

The profile is restricted configuration. Approval still revalidates each referenced definition, the requested class and jurisdiction, reviewer permissions, current application version, and the downstream dealer/license commands.

### `application_endorsement_requests`

Requested endorsement, scope, and applicant justification for an application.

### `application_reviews`

Append-only review events, evidence requests, interviews, recommendations, and decisions.

### `licenses`

Issued legal or institutional authority.

Key fields:

- `id`, `public_reference`
- `holder_party_id`
- `dealer_authorization_id` nullable
- `license_class_id`, `jurisdiction_id`
- `status` such as provisional, active, suspended, revoked, expired, or surrendered
- `issued_at`, `effective_from`, `expires_at`
- `issued_by`, `approved_by`
- `source_application_id`
- `policy_version_id` nullable
- `public_notes`, `private_notes`

Pending and under-review are application states. `expiring_soon` is derived. Revocation and suspension details belong in status history and enforcement records, not only the current row.

### `license_status_events`

Append-only transitions with effective time, actor, reason, related compliance action, and previous/new status.

Implementation note: issuance and accepted status changes write this history in the same transaction. Each event has a unique request identifier for safe retry behavior.

### `license_endorsements`

An effective-dated endorsement granted to a license.

Key fields:

- `license_id`, `endorsement_definition_id`
- `status`
- `effective_from`, `expires_at`
- `scope_configuration`
- `granted_by`, `source_application_id`

### `license_conditions`

Structured or templated conditions that may apply to a license or endorsement.

Key fields:

- `license_id`, optional `license_endorsement_id`
- `condition_definition_id`
- `parameters`
- `effective_from`, `effective_until`
- `public_visibility`
- `imposed_by`, `reason`

Conditions that influence eligibility must be machine-readable or explicitly connected to a rule; prose alone cannot enforce policy.

## 7. Catalogue, control, pricing, and quotas

### `items`

Canonical item type.

Key fields:

- `id`, `item_code`, `display_name`
- `category_id`, optional `unit_of_measure_id`
- `description`
- `inventory_mode` such as fungible or serialized
- `status`
- `default_currency_id`

An item name never determines authorization or control behavior.

### `item_categories` and `item_tags`

Configurable classification used for navigation and rule targeting. Tags may be many-to-many through `item_tag_assignments`.

### `item_publications`

Effective-dated public or audience-specific presentation.

Key fields:

- `item_id`, `audience_profile_id`, optional `jurisdiction_id`
- `publication_status`
- `public_name`, `public_description`, `media_reference`
- `availability_display_policy`
- `effective_from`, `effective_until`

Publication does not imply eligibility or stock.

### `control_profiles`

Configurable behavior for classes of controlled goods.

Key fields:

- `id`, `code`, `display_name`
- `requires_staff_review`
- `requires_transaction_approval`
- `requires_serial_tracking`
- `requires_custody_acceptance`
- `default_reservation_duration`
- `public_message_template_id`

Initial seeded profiles may correspond to ordinary, restricted, and unique behavior.

### `item_control_assignments`

Effective-dated attachment of a control profile and requirements to an item, optionally scoped by jurisdiction.

Key fields:

- `item_id`, `control_profile_id`, optional `jurisdiction_id`
- `effective_from`, `effective_until`
- `required_license_class_ids` or normalized rule links
- `required_endorsement_ids` or normalized rule links
- `approval_policy_id` nullable
- `quota_policy_id` nullable
- `circulation_policy_id` nullable

Normalized join tables are preferred where rules must be queried or constrained individually.

### `price_schedules`

Named commercial schedules such as public, wholesale, contract, or special allocation pricing.

Key fields:

- `id`, `code`, `display_name`
- `currency_id`, `status`
- `effective_from`, `effective_until`
- `audience_rule_id` nullable

### `price_rules`

Effective-dated rule records selecting or calculating a price for an item and eligible context.

Key fields:

- `price_schedule_id`, `item_id` or category target
- optional `jurisdiction_id`, `party_id`, `dealer_type_id`, `license_class_id`, `endorsement_id`
- `amount_minor` or approved calculation parameters
- `priority`
- `effective_from`, `effective_until`
- `approved_by`, `policy_version_id`

Rule precedence must be deterministic and tested. Arbitrary executable expressions in data are prohibited unless a safe rules design is approved.

### `quota_policies`

Defines subject, item scope, allowance, window, and hold/consumption behavior.

Key fields:

- `id`, `code`, `subject_type`
- item, category, control, license, or endorsement scope
- `allowance_quantity`
- `window_type`, `window_parameters`
- `carryover_policy`, `reservation_policy`
- `effective_from`, `effective_until`

### `quota_entries`

Append-only allowance adjustments, holds, consumption, releases, and reversals linked to orders or policy actions.

Key fields:

- `quota_policy_id`, `subject_id`
- `entry_type`, `quantity`
- `effective_at`, `window_key`
- `order_line_id` nullable, `reservation_id` nullable
- `reversal_of_id` nullable
- `recorded_by`, `reason`

Remaining quota is derived. Repeated requests must not create duplicate entries.

## 8. Orders and reservations

Implementation status: order intake implements dealer requisition headers and lines, nullable price snapshots, control snapshots, append-only header/line events, version-checked staff review and price commands, dealer/staff cancellation, represented-party audit context, and durable outbox events. Submission deliberately creates no reservation or movement. A later warehouse command may reserve approved fungible demand, and the fulfillment command consumes exactly one current reservation into an issue and fulfilled quantity. ADR 0017 approves an equivalent future staff-assisted entry path in which the staff actor enters a requisition on behalf of the verified licensed business while the business remains `ordering_party_id`; the command and UI are not yet implemented. Dealer-specific price schedules, eligibility rules, drafts, assignments, overrides, quotas, and serialized fulfillment remain future work.

### `orders`

Commercial requisition header.

Key fields:

- `id`, `public_reference`
- `ordering_party_id`, `dealer_authorization_id`
- `license_id` nullable
- `jurisdiction_id`
- `fulfillment_mode` such as wholesale, consignment, institutional issue, or other configured mode
- `status`
- configured `currency_code` snapshot
- `submitted_at`, `requested_by_actor_id`
- staff-assisted source and verified request context when created on behalf of a business
- `assigned_to_actor_id`
- `requested_fulfillment_at`
- `version` for optimistic concurrency where appropriate

### `order_lines`

Key fields:

- `order_id`, `line_number`, `item_id`
- `quantity_requested`, `quantity_approved`, `quantity_fulfilled`
- `status`
- `unit_price_minor_snapshot`
- `price_rule_id_snapshot`, `price_schedule_id_snapshot`
- `eligibility_snapshot`
- `control_profile_id_snapshot`
- `requested_destination_id` nullable

Submitted line snapshots preserve the decision context but do not replace current validation for later consequential transitions.

### `order_status_events` and `order_line_events`

Append-only header and line transition history, with actor, represented party where applicable, reason, previous/new state, and request ID. The current line row is a versioned operational projection; accepted submission, review, price, and cancellation events remain immutable evidence.

### `approvals`

Generic but constrained approval records for orders, price overrides, unique assets, transfers, or other supported subjects.

Key fields:

- `subject_type`, `subject_id`
- `approval_policy_id`, `approval_step`
- `decision`, `decided_by`, `decided_at`
- `reason`, `expires_at`

Database constraints and functions must prevent an actor from satisfying incompatible approval steps where segregation of duties applies.

### `reservations`

Time-bounded stock claim.

Key fields:

- `id`, `order_line_id`, `item_id`
- `warehouse_id` or `inventory_account_id`
- `quantity`
- `status` such as active, consumed, released, expired, or cancelled
- `reserved_at`, `expires_at`
- `consumed_at`, `released_at`
- `created_by`, `release_reason`
- `idempotency_key`

Reservation functions lock or otherwise serialize the relevant stock scope so concurrent requests cannot over-reserve. Partial reservations use separate records or explicit remaining quantities with complete history.

### `order_price_overrides`

Requested and approved changes to a line price.

Key fields:

- `order_line_id`
- `previous_amount_minor`, `requested_amount_minor`, `approved_amount_minor`
- `requested_by`, `reason`
- `approved_by`, `approved_at`
- `status`

## 9. Warehouses, inventory, and transfers

Implementation status: warehouse operations implement configurable warehouses and locations; physical, in-transit custody, and external accounts; immutable posted transaction headers; balanced signed ledger entries; derived on-hand/reserved/available projections; linked reversals; warehouse-scoped staff grants; effective-dated reservations; fungible fulfillment; full-quantity warehouse transfer dispatch and receipt; and Owner-only counted-total reconciliation for ordinary fungible goods. Serialized assets use the dedicated event model in section 10 rather than fungible ledger quantities. Formal count sessions, returns, partial discrepancy resolution, and additional reconciliation approval thresholds remain future work.

### `warehouses`

Physical or controlled facilities with jurisdiction, operating status, and access scope.

### `stock_locations`

Hierarchical locations within or associated with a warehouse, including quarantine or receiving areas. Dealer premises are modeled separately and may be referenced as custody destinations.

### `inventory_accounts`

A logical stock account identifying item, owner, custodian, location, and stock state. This enables custody and ownership to differ for consignment and in-transit stock.

Key fields:

- `id`, `item_id`
- `owner_party_id`
- `custodian_party_id`
- `warehouse_id` or external `location_party_id`
- `stock_state` such as available physical custody, quarantine, damaged, in transit, or external sink/source
- `status`

Accounts do not store editable current quantity.

### `inventory_transactions`

Header grouping an atomic set of ledger entries.

Key fields:

- `id`, `transaction_type`
- `occurred_at`, `posted_at`, `posted_by`
- `source_document_type`, `source_document_id`
- `idempotency_key`
- `reason`
- `reversal_of_id` nullable

### `inventory_ledger_entries`

Immutable quantity movements within an inventory transaction.

Key fields:

- `inventory_transaction_id`
- `inventory_account_id`
- `item_id`
- `quantity_delta`
- `unit_of_measure_id`
- `line_number`

For a fungible item, each posted transaction must balance across appropriate source, destination, or explicitly modeled external accounts. A correction posts a new reversing transaction; it never edits the original entry.

The implemented receipt command creates one negative external-source entry and one positive physical entry in a single statement. Constraint triggers require a zero transaction sum, prevent negative physical balances, and prevent a ledger reversal from reducing on-hand below current effective reservations. Inventory accounts contain classification and custody dimensions but no editable quantity.

The rapid ordinary receipt resolves an active fungible item by stable item code and then invokes the same warehouse-scoped receipt command. It supplies generated source and audit text only when staff omit those optional fields. Items configured as player-sourced-only or serialized are excluded before posting and remain protected by the underlying database invariants.

The fulfillment command creates the inverse balanced issue after marking its reservation consumed in the same transaction. `order_fulfillments` links the reservation, order line, warehouse, quantity, actor, and issue transaction. A reversal adds inverse ledger entries, marks the fulfillment reversed, and reopens demand; it never reactivates the consumed reservation.

`stock_transfers` records the source and destination physical accounts, unchanged owner, quantity, explicit lifecycle, responsible actors, optimistic version, and dispatch/receipt transaction evidence. Dispatch moves quantity from the source physical account to an `in_transit` custody account; receipt clears transit into the destination physical account. `stock_transfer_events` is immutable. A dispatched transfer cannot be cancelled, and a discrepancy keeps its quantity in transit until an authorized receipt or later return/resolution workflow.

### `stock_counts` and `stock_count_lines`

Physical reconciliation sessions and observations. Approval posts ledger adjustments; the count itself never overwrites a balance.

The implemented rapid counted-total command is a deliberately smaller precursor to formal count sessions. It calculates the authorized warehouse total, rejects player-sourced-only and serialized goods, rejects a total below active reservations, and posts only the difference as a `reconciliation` transaction. `stock_activity_entries` retains the stated total, prior total, delta, business date, actor, request, and linked transaction.

### `transfers`

Movement of custody between locations or custodians.

Key fields:

- `id`, `public_reference`
- `source_account_scope`, `destination_account_scope`
- `status`
- `requested_at`, `authorized_at`, `dispatched_at`, `received_at`
- `requested_by`, `authorized_by`, `dispatched_by`, `received_by`
- `related_order_id` nullable
- `custody_terms`

### `transfer_lines`

Item quantities or serialized asset references. Dispatch posts movement to an in-transit account when appropriate; receipt posts movement to the destination. Cancellation after dispatch requires a return or exception workflow, not deletion.

### `consignment_agreements`

Effective-dated commercial terms linking owner, consignee, jurisdiction, price/settlement policy, reporting frequency, loss terms, and allowed items.

The implemented foundation stores owner, consignee, jurisdiction, effective dates, status, free-text terms, optimistic version, request keys, and responsible actors. Closing is prohibited while an issue has outstanding custody. Commercial schedules and executable terms remain separate future configuration rather than free-text business logic.

### `consignment_issues`

One fungible issue links an agreement, item, source warehouse/account, retained-owner consigned custody account, quantity, responsible actor, and balanced issue transaction. Accepted sold and returned totals are versioned projections; outstanding custody is derived as issued minus accepted sold and returned quantities.

### `consignment_reports`

Dealer-reported sales, returns, losses, and on-hand observations. Reports are claims until accepted through an authoritative reconciliation or settlement function.

At most one submitted report exists per issue. Acceptance locks the report, issue, agreement, and involved accounts; validates the observed balance; rejects loss or damage from the ordinary path; and posts one balanced settlement transaction for accepted sold/returned quantities. Rejection records history without an inventory effect. `consignment_events` is immutable, and every command is audited, idempotent, and emits durable outbox work where external notice is useful.

## 10. Serialized assets and custody

Implementation status: the initial serialized registry creates stable `EEC-AST` identities for items configured with serialized inventory mode; preserves separate owner, custodian, warehouse, and location fields as transactionally consistent event projections; enforces one active allocation per asset and order line; records registration, release or expiry, accepted custody, inspection, condition, loss, recovery, seizure, retirement, and destruction events; and emits audited outbox work. Registration is warehouse-scoped, all exposed tables are denied directly, and staff commands are permission checked, version checked, reasoned, idempotent, and append-only. Transaction-specific approval, reservation consumption into unique fulfillment, dealer custody views, public disclosure, formal corrections, and evidence attachments remain policy-gated increments.

### `serialized_assets`

One record per individually controlled item.

Key fields:

- `id`, `asset_code`, `item_id`
- `serial_or_marking` nullable
- `status`
- `registered_at`, `registered_by`
- `provenance_summary` subject to visibility controls

Do not treat an asset's editable `current_holder` column as authoritative.

### `asset_events`

Append-only lifecycle and custody events.

Key fields:

- `asset_id`, `event_type`
- `occurred_at`, `recorded_at`, `recorded_by`
- `from_custodian_party_id`, `to_custodian_party_id`
- `from_location_id`, `to_location_id`
- `condition_before`, `condition_after`
- `transfer_id`, `order_line_id`, or `compliance_case_id` nullable
- `accepted_by` and `accepted_at` when custody acceptance is required
- `reversal_of_id` nullable
- `reason`

Authoritative functions enforce a valid event sequence and exactly one current custody state.

### `asset_reservations`

Exclusive, time-bounded allocation of a serialized asset to an order line or approved purpose. A partial unique-asset reservation is impossible.

The current staff path allocates only one approved serialized order line with quantity one, uses a fixed initial 48-hour term, and explicitly finalizes release or elapsed expiry. Allocation does not move custody and cannot be mistaken for fulfillment.

### `asset_inspections`

Inspection observations, condition, custodian confirmation, next due date, evidence references, and findings. Sensitive evidence uses private object storage with access controls.

## 11. Compliance

### `compliance_cases`

Case container linked through join tables to parties, licenses, orders, transfers, or assets.

Key fields:

- `id`, `case_reference`, `case_type_id`
- `status`
- `opened_at`, `opened_by`, `assigned_to`
- `confidentiality_level`
- `summary`, `closed_at`, `resolution`

Implementation status: the case register uses configured case types, an optional subject party, a validated optional link to an existing license, dealer authorization, order, stock transfer, serialized asset, or consignment issue, explicit confidentiality, assignment, optimistic version, request idempotency, and immutable events. The implemented transition graph preserves resolve/no-action/close/reopen history and requires a written resolution before a resolved or no-action state.

### `inspections`

Scheduled or completed compliance activity with scope, participants, observations, and evidence references.

The implemented inspection record is planned, completed, or cancelled. Completion requires observations. An inspection is evidence-gathering activity and never creates a finding by itself.

### `allegations` and `findings`

Separate tables or explicitly separated record types. A finding must not be inferred merely because an allegation exists.

Implemented allegations, findings, and evidence metadata are append-only. Findings use explicit `substantiated`, `not_substantiated`, or `inconclusive` outcomes and may reference an allegation without modifying it. Evidence records store an approved reference, description, type, classification, and collection time; they do not store secrets or grant access to an underlying file.

### `enforcement_actions`

Recorded actions such as notice, condition, quota adjustment, suspension, seizure, or revocation. Exact types are configurable.

Key fields:

- `case_id`, `action_type_id`
- `subject_type`, `subject_id`
- `status`
- `effective_from`, `effective_until`
- `authorized_by`, `authorized_at`
- `reason`, `public_notice_text` nullable

If an action changes another domain's state, one function must post both the enforcement action and the domain transition atomically.

The current action type constraint permits `record_only` effects only. Recommendations may be approved, declined, or voided, but `effect_applied` is constrained false. This creates reviewable case history without inventing a license, dealer, inventory, order, quota, or asset effect.

### `appeals`

Links appellant, challenged action, filing date, status, reviewer, decision, and effective outcome. Whether an appeal stays an action is policy-controlled.

The implemented appeal register permits one filed appeal per approved record-only action and records an explicit affirmed, varied, remanded, or reversed outcome (or withdrawal). It does not infer standing, deadlines, independence, stays, notice, or cross-domain restoration.

## 12. Audit, integrations, and projections

### `audit_log`

Append-only record of consequential activity.

Key fields:

- `id`, `occurred_at`
- `actor_id`, `auth_user_id`, `actor_type`
- `action`
- `record_type`, `record_id`
- `previous_state`, `new_state`
- `reason`
- `request_id`, `correlation_id`
- `source_surface`
- `sensitivity_class`

Write access is limited to trusted functions. Update and delete are denied. A redaction policy must govern sensitive snapshots.

### `outbox_events`

Durable events created in the same transaction as business state.

Key fields:

- `id`, `event_type`, `aggregate_type`, `aggregate_id`
- `payload_version`, `payload`
- `occurred_at`, `available_at`
- `status`, `attempt_count`, `last_error`
- `deduplication_key`

Implementation note: licensing, order, and inventory commands emit versioned events into this durable table. The projection-integration increment materializes only configured event routes, leases delivery attempts, records external message metadata, retries safe failures, and never makes outbox or message state authoritative for the source transaction.

### `integration_deliveries`

One row per event destination and attempt history or delivery summary.

Key fields:

- `outbox_event_id`, `destination_type`, `destination_reference`
- `status`, `attempt_count`
- `first_attempted_at`, `delivered_at`, `last_error`
- `external_message_id` nullable

An external message ID is delivery metadata, not business authority.

Implementation note: the current schema separates non-secret `integration_destinations`, versioned `notification_templates`, configured `integration_event_routes`, and per-event `integration_deliveries`. Destination and route deactivation stops new claims. Leases, attempt limits, deduplication keys, worker IDs, errors, manual replay, and audit snapshots provide an inspectable delivery history. Secrets never enter these tables.

### `export_definitions`

Approved projection source, column contract, destination reference, refresh policy, and visibility.

The initial definitions are disabled by default and cover only approved public catalogue, dealer, and license fields. Their shared Google spreadsheet identifier is a non-secret destination reference; credential material stays in the server environment.

### `export_runs`

Records watermark, row count, generated-at time, checksum, destination version, status, attempts, and error. It does not import Sheet edits.

The current worker uses a unique scheduled or manual run key, a time-bounded lease, bounded automatic retry, and full-tab replacement. A manual replay is a new audited operational decision on existing delivery state; it cannot mutate a catalogue, dealer, license, order, or inventory record.

### Public views and functions

Expected projections include:

- `public_catalogue_v`
- `public_license_verification(...)`
- `public_dealer_verification(...)`
- `dealer_catalogue(...)`
- `dealer_order_summary(...)`
- `staff_inventory_position_v`
- `staff_work_queue_v`

The implemented public functions are `public_license_verification(text)` and `public_dealer_verification(text)`. They return one fixed response row and indistinguishable unknown, malformed, unpublished, private-record, and non-public-status behavior. Other names remain provisional.

## 13. Cross-domain invariants

The database and secure business functions must enforce at least these invariants:

1. A submitted order line retains its price, eligibility, and control-rule provenance.
2. A reservation cannot exceed authoritatively available stock at commit time. Order submission may precede stock availability and does not itself create a reservation.
3. The same idempotency key cannot post the same business operation twice.
4. Posted inventory entries are immutable and corrections reference the original transaction.
5. A serialized asset has at most one active reservation and one current accepted custodian.
6. Unique-asset fulfillment references the specific asset, not only an item quantity.
7. A license cannot be active outside its effective interval or after a terminal revocation or surrender event.
8. An endorsement cannot authorize activity outside the containing license's authority or dates.
9. An actor can act for a dealer only within an active representative grant and session scope.
10. A dealer-facing or public query cannot expose private notes, risk data, evidence, credential metadata, or internal-only goods.
11. A quota hold and a stock reservation created for one order line commit or roll back together when policy couples them.
12. Dispatch and receipt record in-transit custody; post-dispatch cancellation cannot erase movement.
13. Consignment tracks owner and custodian independently.
14. A consequential status change creates both domain history and an audit record in the same transaction.
15. An integration failure cannot undo committed business state, and a retry cannot duplicate business state.

## 14. Transaction boundaries and concurrency

Candidate secure functions, with final names to be decided during implementation:

- `submit_order`
- `evaluate_order_line`
- `approve_order_line`
- `reserve_inventory`
- `release_reservation`
- `expire_reservations`
- `post_inventory_transaction`
- `reverse_inventory_transaction`
- `dispatch_transfer`
- `receive_transfer`
- `allocate_serialized_asset`
- `transfer_asset_custody`
- `issue_license`
- `change_license_status`
- `grant_endorsement`
- `apply_enforcement_action`

Each function must:

- Authenticate the actor and resolve scoped authorization
- Re-read relevant current records inside the transaction
- Validate the state transition and approved policy version
- Use row locks, advisory locks, serializable isolation, or equivalent protection appropriate to the invariant
- Apply all coupled records atomically
- Record domain history and audit data
- Emit outbox events when needed
- Return a stable typed result
- Handle retry safely through an idempotency key where the caller may repeat a request

## 15. Row-level security direction

RLS is required on every exposed table.

- Anonymous users receive no direct table grants; they query explicit public views/functions.
- Dealer sessions can read only the parties they represent and records intentionally exposed to that relationship.
- Dealer writes are limited to safe draft or request inputs and preferably routed through secure functions.
- Staff access is constrained by active role assignment, jurisdiction, warehouse, and subject scope.
- Integration principals can execute only purpose-built projection or delivery functions.
- Service-role credentials remain server-only and are not a substitute for application authorization checks.
- Audit, compliance evidence, access grants, external identities, and contact data receive especially narrow policies.

RLS policy tests must include anonymous, wrong dealer, expired representative, cross-region staff, correct role, elevated role, and integration-principal cases.

## 16. Data import and migration

Legacy workbook import is staged, never loaded directly into authoritative tables.

Suggested flow:

1. Store the source file and checksum outside public access.
2. Import raw rows into a restricted staging schema with source sheet and row identifiers.
3. Normalize numeric money, Boolean display values, item names, categories, and duplicate records.
4. Map duplicated catalogue rows to one canonical item and explicit price rules.
5. Treat ambiguous limits such as blank, `None`, or `0` as unresolved mappings, not assumptions.
6. Validate references, conflicts, required fields, and totals.
7. Produce an exception report for product-owner decisions.
8. Promote approved mappings through an idempotent migration or import function.
9. Retain provenance so each imported record can be traced to its source row.

## 17. Assumptions

- PostgreSQL extensions used by Supabase may support cryptography, scheduling, and UUID generation, subject to environment review.
- Multiple representatives may act for one dealer, and one actor may represent multiple parties.
- Inventory uses a double-entry-style movement model for fungible stock and an event model for serialized assets.
- Reservations are claims separate from physical ledger balances.
- Business state and integration delivery state reside in the same PostgreSQL project but have distinct permissions.
- Public references are non-secret identifiers; private access tokens are separate, high-entropy secrets.

## 18. Unresolved modeling decisions

- Whether authorization rules use fully normalized policy tables, a constrained JSON rule format, or a versioned hybrid
- Whether stock ledger quantities are signed single-account entries or explicit debit/credit pairs at the API boundary
- Unit-of-measure conversion requirements and whether fractional quantities are allowed
- Exact owner and custodian parties for received, in-transit, sold, destroyed, seized, and unknown stock accounts
- Whether quotas are reserved on submission, approval, or stock reservation; order submission itself is permitted without stock
- Whether circulation ceilings are another quota policy or a separate aggregate constraint
- Price rule precedence and allowed calculation forms; price records may be absent and must never default to zero
- Reservation extension limits and detailed transfer, consignment, and settlement granularity beyond approved partial order handling
- Which license conditions require normalized enforcement fields
- Whether factor assignments are always staff identities or may represent contracted external parties
- Public-reference formats and whether identifiers encode jurisdiction or class
- Public history retention after expiration, revocation, correction, merger, or party rename
- Evidence storage, encryption, redaction, deletion, and legal retention policy
- Required historical snapshots for catalogue presentation and generated documents

These decisions must be captured in an approved decision record before the corresponding migrations are implemented.

## 19. Player-sourced procurement and reserve economy

ADR 0018 adds an economic-provenance layer above the existing immutable inventory ledger.

### `item_supply_policies`

One configurable current policy per canonical item. It records the supply mode, whether procurement is enabled, whether player sourcing is mandatory, whether generic receipts are allowed, reserve thresholds, direct-personal-order policy, personal weekly limit, and business bulk-review threshold. Numeric thresholds may remain null until policy approves them. They are comparison values, never balances.

### `procurement_suppliers`

Links a supplier registry record to one party and assigns a stable `EEC-SUP-*` reference. Supplier standing is independent of dealer authorization, licenses, representative access, and staff identity. A miner can sell ore without becoming an authorized wholesaler.

### `procurement_offers`

An effective-dated guaranteed purchase offer for one item and currency. It snapshots the amount per item unit, minimum accepted delivery, optional staff-review quantity, notes, and author. Overlapping active offers for the same item and currency are rejected. An offer creates neither stock nor debt by itself.

The simplified price command serializes changes by item and currency, retires overlapping active offers, and inserts one new current offer with a fresh request identifier and audit context. It never edits a delivery snapshot or deletes earlier offers. The ordinary interface supplies a configured minimum quantity of one and leaves optional review thresholds unset; advanced policy records may still use the full offer command.

### `procurement_deliveries`

Evidence that a registered supplier delivered an accepted quantity against a current offer. It snapshots the item, quantity, rate, rounded total, currency, warehouse/location, receiving actor, and immutable inventory transaction. Settlement status is pending until staff records an external payment or voucher reference. This operational status is not a treasury balance.

### `stock_activity_entries`

Immutable provenance for the simple activity journal. `anonymous_purchase` stores item, quantity, business occurrence date, derived warehouse/location, previous/resulting stock, ledger transaction, and the effective purchase-rate snapshot when one exists. Supplier is intentionally absent. A purchase without an effective rate is `unpriced` with null money fields, never zero. A priced aggregate purchase is treated as paid at intake.

`count_reconciliation` stores the stated total and the calculated delta for an ordinary fungible good. It has no purchase money. Both activity types retain the exact recording actor, request identifier, creation timestamp, audit row, and durable outbox event.

The original **Money** cashbook is now one source feeding the authoritative fictional-currency ledger described in ADR 0033. Paid aggregate purchases, paid named-supplier deliveries, and paid consignment settlements post expenditure from Company Treasury. Unpriced purchases remain exceptions and never invent a zero amount.

### `financial_accounts`, `financial_transactions`, and `financial_entries`

`financial_accounts` stores identity, type, optional owning party, currency, lifecycle status, and version; it deliberately stores no balance. `financial_transactions` is the immutable business header and source link. `financial_entries` contains signed account movements. A deferred constraint requires at least two entries and a zero signed sum for every transaction. Balance is the entry sum; available balance subtracts current holds.

Company books and the Bank do not have separate ledgers. They are bounded projections of these records: Company books includes the `company_treasury` account and operating receivables/expenditure; the Bank customer register includes only `business`, `personal`, and `escrow` accounts. `staff_record_treasury_cash_infusion` posts from the hidden `external` account to the configured Treasury and retains the occurrence date, source reference, actor, reason, and idempotency request.

### Sales invoices

`sales_invoices` is a one-to-one receivable for an order. Immutable invoice lines snapshot approved quantity and price. `sales_invoice_payments` links each partial payment to one balanced transaction. Invoice status advances from open to partially paid to paid; an unpaid open invoice may be voided with version and reason.

### Holds and account lifecycle

`financial_account_holds` reserves available money without changing ledger balance. Release is effective-dated evidence. Frozen accounts keep their history and balance but reject movement. A nonzero account, an account with an active hold, or an account servicing an active/defaulted loan cannot be closed.

### Loans

`loan_products` stores reusable effective terms. `loans` snapshots the selected rate, frequency, principal, dates, and borrower account. `loan_installments` records principal, interest, fees, due dates, status, and version. `loan_payments` is immutable money evidence; `loan_payment_allocations` assigns each payment to the oldest fee, interest, then principal obligation. Disbursement and repayment are balanced Treasury/account transactions.

### Banking controls

`invoice_payment_reversals` and `loan_payment_reversals` identify the exact payment and compensating transaction. A loan correction appends negative `loan_payment_allocations` linked to the original allocations, allowing all due totals to remain sums rather than mutable projections.

`loan_fee_assessment_runs` records every servicing batch; `loan_late_fee_assessments` records the one permitted configured charge per overdue installment. `financial_reconciliations` stores the stated, ledger-derived, and difference amounts without posting an entry. `financial_periods` stores close/reopen evidence, while `financial_period_account_balances` freezes the ledger-derived account snapshot through the close date.

### Banking invariants

1. Balances and available funds are derived in PostgreSQL and cannot be edited.
2. Posted transaction headers, entries, invoice lines/payments, and loan payments/allocations are immutable.
3. A request identifier makes retryable monetary commands idempotent.
4. A transaction locks both accounts before checking status, currency, and funds.
5. A business projection is limited to actively represented parties and reveals no counterparty account register.
6. Generic reversal cannot be used for invoice or loan payments; their allocation/status requires a domain-specific correction.
7. Registers are searched and paginated server-side; routine workspace arrays are bounded.
8. Payment correction copies the exact inverse of the original entries and never depends on the counterparty account still being active.
9. Reconciliation never changes a balance; it records a matched comparison or visible variance.
10. A closed date range rejects new backdated transactions until an authorized reasoned reopen.

### Coupled invariants

1. Player-sourced-only goods reject positive physical ledger entries posted by the generic receipt permission.
2. Receiving a procurement delivery and its balanced ledger receipt succeeds or fails as one transaction.
3. The delivery item and rate come from the current effective offer, not browser calculations.
4. Named deliveries revalidate supplier, offer, policy, location, warehouse scope, minimum quantity, and actor permission. Aggregate anonymous purchases revalidate item policy, warehouse scope, date, and actor permission but do not require a supplier or offer.
5. Retrying with the same request ID returns the existing logical result.
6. Settlement changes only the versioned delivery settlement fields and appends audit/outbox evidence; it does not move stock.
7. Dashboard reserve positions derive from ledger entries and live reservations. Approved unfulfilled demand is shown separately as back-order pressure.
8. Aggregate purchase money is calculated only from an offer effective on the occurrence date. No offer produces an explicit unpriced entry.
9. Counted totals create a balanced reconciliation difference and never mutate a stored balance.

## 20. Rapid configuration transaction

`staff_quick_create_item` composes existing domain boundaries in one database transaction. It requires catalogue and supply-policy authority for every call, plus publication, pricing, and warehouse-receipt authority only when those optional effects are requested. It creates no partial item if any selected effect fails. Supply-mode behavior is selected from constrained machine codes and is never inferred from an item name or category label.

`staff_set_item_public_terms` closes the previous current public presentation before inserting its successor. When staff choose an explicit price action, it independently closes and replaces or clears the current rule for the selected schedule. Both commands are idempotent, audited, and emit durable projection events.

## 21. Launch command model additions

- `commercial_channel_policies`: multiplier and weekly-window policy; direct individual is approved at `30000` basis points.
- `price_schedule_bindings`: effective-dated deterministic dealer pricing precedence.
- `direct_customer_profiles` and `personal_quota_entries`: stable customer identity plus held/consumed/released weekly quantity.
- `license_applications`, requested endorsements, and `license_renewal_events`: public intake and reviewed authority changes.
- `consignment_finance_terms` and `consignment_settlements`: configurable commission and frozen settlement evidence.
- `unique_fulfillments`: immutable reservation, asset, line, recipient, actor, and handoff link.
- `compliance_effect_executions`: exact previous/new target state for approved configured sanctions.
- `generated_documents`: immutable source payload, version, checksum, actor, reason, and reference.

Orders now identify dealer, assisted-business, or direct-individual channel. Lines freeze schedule/rule IDs, price source, base price, multiplier, and final amount so later configuration cannot rewrite historical obligations.
